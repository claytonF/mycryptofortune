# mycryptofortune


If you have your crypto stored in many different wallets it can be difficult to keep track of how they are performing.

mycryptofortune is a simple site to keep track of how much profit (roughly) ... or loss you are making on your crypto.

At the moment I'm just getting the basic functionality together. Refactoring and styling on the way.
